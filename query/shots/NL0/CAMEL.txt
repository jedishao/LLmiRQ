849	component endpoint bean property mina component / endpoint - easier spring configurationThe camel-mina component and the endpoint should be spring xml firendly for configuration.So you can configure the endpoint in the spring xml as a bean and use it in the routing. The configuration in spring should support IDE property completion so can easily see which properties this endpoint supports and set them using simple text values.
871	DataFormat Route camel-spring - data format using camel xml elements doesnt workIf you have a route that uses data format and you configure the data format using camel xml elements it doesn&amp;apos;t work.See nabble:http://www.nabble.com/xstream-in-xml-configuration-td19227970s22882.html
881	null camel-mina - codec options should fail if not possible to find i registryIf you configure the codec option on camel-mina and you eg make a spelling mistake camel will default to Mina default protocol if not found. We should throw an exception instead so end user knows about this and can fix his spelling mistake.
894	FTPConsumer camel-ftp - handle invalid login betterIf the login to the FTP server fails then Camel will at the 2nd pool still try to consume files from the ftp server as it has network connection, but end-user is still not connected.

1057	XQuery XQuery creates an empty out message that makes it impossible to chain more processors behind itWhen using XQuery the getOut() function is called on the message so if it is not used at a place where the out is filled an empty out message will be created. With this xquery cannot be used for example in setBody, setHeader... and anywhere where the out is not filled.An example where this causes real trouble:&lt;choice&gt;&lt;when&gt;&lt;xquery&gt;...&lt;/xquery&gt;&lt;to uri="direct:follow" /&gt;&lt;/when&gt;&lt;/choice&gt;...&lt;from uri="direct:follow"&gt;&lt;to ...&gt;&lt;to ...&gt;In the patch the out property in the xquery context is filled only if it is not null.

1379	Endpoint Configuration Mina configuration is shared between endpointsEstablishing a MINA endpoint with a custom codec, and then establishing another without a custom codec is a problem. The second endpoint inherits the first endpoint&amp;apos;s codec.My recommendation is to not share configuration data between endpoint creation. I recommend that the MINA component instantiate a new configuration for each new endpoint instead of copying the previous configuration.As a workaround the user can specify "codec" as a URI parameter with no value.

1774	header cxfbean does not propagate in http response code to Camel header
1780	CamelContext Allow for templated/common routesThis is a follow-up from my exchange with Claus on the user-forum. If the camel routes are spread across multiple files, it&amp;apos;d be very useful to allow for a templating or hierarchical mechanism that&amp;apos;d allow for common routes (in my case Exception processing) to be re-used without copy-pasting in the different files.http://www.nabble.com/Multiple-camelContext-elements-in-camel-2.0.m2-Spring-DSL-td24293351.html

1913	Message Header Body camel-jetty - Should support multipart/form posted data in the message body betterSee CAMEL-1801It does not work as expected as the posted data should be in the body and not as it does currently stored as a message header with the body as a key and with an empty value!For instance sending a file using curlcurl -F data=@src/test/data/plain.txt http://localhost:9080/myapp/myserviceYou want Camel to provide the file content in the body and the other as headers. But what you get in the body is------------------------------30cc29f24df6Content-Disposition: form-data; name="data"; filename="plain.txt"Content-Type: text/plainHello WorldThis is the second line------------------------------30cc29f24df6--
1919	RouteBuilder Include route builder as template for other routes to improve route reuseIt should be possible to include another route builder as a kind of template to improve route reuse.The existing method addRoutes should either be change to support this properly or we add a new method.However it does looks as if we could just tailor addRoutes method.What needs also is to expose this in the Spring XML as well.
1982	JMSBinding JMSBinding needs to be able to deal with an null endpointmigrating activemq from 2.0-M2 to 2.0.0 some tests fail with internal NPE - problem is activemq camel uses JMSBinding() no arg creation and some of the methods do not check for a null endpoint.

2059	error pipeline Creating a transacted pipeline with custom error handling is difficultWhen trying to add error logging to a transacted pipeline, I discovered the following issues:(1) onException/onCompletion do not work in a transacted route(2) if the transacted tag is not the first element in the route, all the endpoints above it will be silently ignored(3) custom error handlers interact very awkwardly with transacted routes (specifically, a non-transacted error handler will not work at all on a transacted route)I was able to solve my problem using doTry/doCatch; this may be a good candidate for adding to the docs.I suggest that, if the above issues are not corrected (especially 2+3, which may not be route designs that it is desired to support), they should trigger errors in the corresponding pipeline.I have attached a tgz of examples showing problems (1) and (2) above, as well as my successful route.
2060	Bean Component Bean Endpoint Bean Camel Bean component should not remember the last called method name if the bean&apos;s method name is not explicitly specified.Here is the mail thread which discuses this issue.http://www.nabble.com/Bean-endpoint-in-a-route-is-holding-reference-to-the-last-used-methodName-and-does-not-invoke-Camel%27s-Bean-binding-tp25838095p25838095.html
2072	null camel-mail - extracting mails with headers using multi values inserts duplicatesSending a message with headers that contains 2 values such a String[] with 2 values will result on the other side when consuming that mail message to contain a header with 2 entries. There should only be 1 entry with the 2 values.
2075	annotation foo method camel-bean - When a method name is given it should be more strict to be sure always invoking a method with that nameYou could potential invoke another method name if you have annotated that with a Camel annotation. Even if you have told Camel that the method should be named foo etc.What Camel should do is to ensure that only methods with the name foo is possible to invoke.
2084	ConsumerTemplate method http polling consumer does not support timeoutWhen using the consumer template to receive from a remote http service using camel-http the method receive(5000) that uses a 5 sec timeout does not work as expected.Camel does not use the 5000 value.
2090	null camel-jms - Option autoStartup does not workIt does in fact auto startup it anyway.
2092	VelocityEndpoint Pipeline velocity endpoint should not remember the last used template uriIf there are two velocity endpoint linked with the pipeline, you will find the last velocity will not effect anymore.
2128	JmsMessage Rollback does not work for transactional routes using camel-cxfI have a request reply service that should be able to do three differentthings:1)  no exception occurs in the implementation: The jms Message should becommitted and the normal reply should be sent2) The implementation throws an exception defined in the service contract:The jms message should be committed and a fault should be sent3) The implemementation throws another kind of exception: The message delivery shouldbe rolled back so it can be received againCase 1 and 2 currently work as expected.For Case 3 a fault is returned to the caller and the transaction is committed which is wrong.
2132	message Serializable message camel-jms - Sending Object message should fail if payload cannot be converted to serializableIf not a null message is created and send.See nabble:http://old.nabble.com/JPA%3A-Could-not-pass-Object-from-jpa-to-jms-to26160124.html
2186	FtpEndpoint if ftp endpoint is not writeable, the only messages you get are logged at DEBUG level.Using the same project attached to CAMEL-2165, you can delete the "ftp_home" directory, or simply edit user.properties to make the ftp account readonly.While every single write to the camel ftp endpoint will then fail, the only notification of this is at DEBUG level.  In my opinion this should be at least WARN

2336	null Spring DSL - Some route scoped concerns such as onException etc. can vanish in some edge casesThe JAXB creates the Spring DSL model in a bit wacky way so we need to work on it a bit before Camel can create the runtime routes.In some cases some of the cross functions such as onCompletion, onException could potentially vanish.The problem is really that we should have divided the route into a upper / lower section where upper is the cross functions and the lower the actual route.

2395	FileComponent file component - Using fileName option should better detect constant vs dynamic nameeg using fileName=header.txt makes Camel think its header with the name txt you want to use.
2439	null File consumer - Consuming from absolute paths can cause issue on Windows when moving file when doneWhen using a file consumer with an absolute path, eg from("file:/data") then when the process is done and it wants to move the file to .camel sub dir of /data it may not do that correctly on Windows.The issue is the logic in Camel is based upon that a path starting with \ is considered absolute, as it is on Unix OS and other platforms. Where as on Windows java.io.File returns false for such files. The other return true. So we need to cater for this and make Windows return true as well so the logic is consistent across OS.
2476	Component Exchange Header Property Camel Velocity: change the case of all fields properties HeaderUsing the velocity component doesn&amp;apos;t respect the case matching of all fields of the header.For example: the exchange of properties CorrelationID change the case matching, after using velocity component, it puts the property in lowercase correlationid.

2952	null camel-ftp - Support polling from MVS file systemThe MVS file system requires to change directory to starting path and use CD to traverse file path instead of using listFile(path) as currently done in camel-ftp.This means we should walk the path using code like:0. remember path1. cd path2. list files()3. loop files4. if dir then goto 15. if file add file6. when done cd back to "remember path"
2972	null onException not working correctly when using routeContextWhen using a routeContext, the last (in the xml-file) defined route-scoped &lt;onException&gt; configuration is shared by the other routes in the context.http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/possible-onException-bug-when-using-routeContext-td1616244.html#a1616244

3079	Context Job Endpoint Job job rescheduling and clustering does not work properlyCurrently stateful cron jobs are identified by their group name, job name and the cron expression. This prevents an easy rescheduling of cron jobs. For instance, stopping a camel context, rescheduling the cron job by editing the cron expressing and restart will end up in an exception. This will happen because the rescheduled job will be added as an additional job. The already existing job will produce an exception because the corresponding endpoint doesn&amp;apos;t exist anymore. The previous solution deleting all triggers on shutdown doesn&amp;apos;t work in a cluster scenario.I suggest to identify cron jobs only by their group and job name. On startup it will check if a trigger already exists and check if the cron expression has changed. If so it will be rescheduled.Also the current explicit resuming of stateful jobs will produce an exception during startup, because the scheduler automatically finds and resumes stored triggers.

3448	Route Route scoped onException may pick onException from another route if they are the same class typeIf you have a clash with route scoped onException and have the exact same class, then the key in the map isn&amp;apos;t catering for this. And thus a 2nd route could override the 1st route onException definition.For example:from X route AonException IOExceptionfrom Y route BonException IOExceptionThe map should contain 2 entries, but unfortunately it only contain 1. This only happens when its an exact type match.

("&lt;hello/&gt;", "&lt;hallo/&gt;", "&lt;hellos/&gt;")Here we should receive 1 message in each of the mocks. For whatever reason, all 3 messages go to mock:english. Similar routes work as expected with the Java DSL.

3560	registry Detect uncaught exceptions in UoWProcessor to ensure UoW is done even for those uncaught exceptionsThe Camel routing engines will handle this in 99.9% of the cases, but when you shutdown a Spring AC then Spring may stop beans in whatever order and this can cause those beans to fail operating during a graceful shutdown. And in worst case exceptions is thrown in situations where they are not normally done.To cater for that and other situations the UoWProcessor should detect this and act accordingly.This ensure the in flight registry will be tracked and we are not stuck with a missing inflight message, causing Camel to wait for the 300 sec timeout to shutdown.For example just try hitting ctrl + c in that camel-example-management and you can see such an example.
3673	CamelContext Route Property placeholders do not work with camel-blueprintif I have a route that looks like:&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"xmlns:cm="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-cm/v1.0.0" xmlns:ext="http://aries.apache.org/blueprint/xmlns/blueprint-ext/v1.0.0"xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0/blueprint.xsd"&gt;&lt;cm:property-placeholder persistent-id="camel.blueprint" /&gt;&lt;camelContext id="camel" trace="false" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"&gt;&lt;route&gt;&lt;from uri="file://${directory.in}/" /&gt;&lt;to uri="file://${directory.out}/" /&gt;&lt;/route&gt;&lt;/camelContext&gt;&lt;/blueprint&gt;The placeholders aren&amp;apos;t replaced by the actual value.

3801	component component processor bean route Allow to send the Query as a Body + Header Message in exchange to the SQL componentThe existing SQL component requires that the query is attached to the endpoint and parameters provided as a List when we would like to replace the # symbol by those values.The JDBC component adopts a different philosophy as the query can be build in a processor, bean or setBody and send to the JDBC endpoint.Using the following syntax could be much more flexible to setup dynamically queries :&lt;route id="insert-from-file"&gt;&lt;from uri="file://target/datainsert?moveFailed=failed"/&gt;&lt;setBody&gt;&lt;simple&gt;INSERT INTO REPORT.T_INCIDENT (INCIDENT_REF,INCIDENT_DATE,GIVEN_NAME,FAMILY_NAME,SUMMARY,DETAILS,EMAIL,PHONE)VALUES (&amp;apos;${body}&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;2011-03-21&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;Charles&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;Moulliard&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;Incident&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;This is a report incident for webinar-001&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;cmoulliard@fusesource.com&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;+111 10 20 300&amp;apos;)&lt;/simple&gt;&lt;/setBody&gt;&lt;to uri="sql"/&gt;&lt;/route&gt;
3901	report Create a separate component for camel transport for cxfThe camel-cxf component curently contains too many unrelated functions. It contains:camel transport for cxfcxf componentcxfbean componentcxfrs componetconvertersSo this causes the code of the component to depend on each other and suck in much too many dependencies. Besides this there are some package dependency cycles in the code which could easily be solved.A first step is to separate the camel transport for cxf from the rest of the code. It is independent of all other code and can be pulled into a new component.Some advantages are:The camel transport for cxf needs very few dependencies so it is a vey light weight aproach to combine cxf and camelThe new component nicely shows how to bridge between cxd and camel without the overhead of the other componentsWe can let the camel-cxf component depdend on the camel transport for cxf so for people using maven no changes are neededI will attach a patch where I simply deleted anything that is not relevant for camel transport for cxf from the camel-cxf project. This is of course not yet the solution but it shows how small the new component will be and is a good start for doing the split.I would be very interested about opinions from other developers about the split.Christian
3907	Exchange Component Component camel-sql needs the abiliity to process sql from the body of the exchangecamel sql should also support the ability to add the sql statements in the exchange body for processing.  This is linked via 3803.
4225	MailComponent MailConfiguration MailConsumer MailProducer camel-mail: add disconnect optionA perpetually open connection to an email server can cause problems under various circumstances.  There should therefore be a "disconnect" option (default: false) that causes the connection to be closed after each action taken  mail read from a folder, a message flagged for deletion, a message sent, etc.
4456	MailMessage camel-mail - Add option to control if mail folder should be closed after pollIt should be possible to control if the mail folder should be closed after a poll or not.For example if people is routing mails over SEDA or other async endpoints, then we should not close the mail folder before the mail message is being processed async.We have a similar option on mina,netty etc. named disconnect. So the option could be named like that as well.
5024	null Streaming splitter ignores exception handlingIf an exception occurs on the next() call of an Iterator in a streaming splitter, the exception is never propagated to the exception or the error handler. This will lead to improper route termination, and inifite rollback/retry cycles.I attached the minimal test case demonstrating the issue.
5255	null Add all SNMPv1 TRAP PDU information to message body for camel-snmp componentThe attached patch captures additional information available in an SNMPv1 TRAP PDU (enterprise trap ID, agent-addr, generic trap ID, specific trap ID, and system uptime) to the camel-snmp message body.

7146	Context NPE in Aggregator when completionSize = 1A Camel aggregator with persistence repository cannot have a completionSize of 1. If this is configured, every message produces a NPE with the attached stacktrace.I have also attached a small example project that shows the Exception. As soon as the completionSize is &gt; 1, it runs fine.This is just a minor flaw, since I cannot think about a really useful case with completionSize 1, but it worked with earlier versions of Camel.As an alternative (if completionSize 1 should not be used), Camel could throw an error during Context startup when completionSize &lt; 2.
7159	null camel-bindy not picking up @Link annotation itemsIt works fine (like in the tests) when you provide bindy with a Map&lt;String, Object&gt; of model objects corresponding to the @Linked-ed classes. We should do better though and try to figure this out for users.

7855	Route Endpoint If you suspend a JMS route that is stopped, calling resume on it does not work and reports no errorIf a route that consumes from JMS is in state Stopped, and first Suspend and then Resume are called upon it, the route reports itself as being in state Started. However, it is not actually consuming anything from the endpoint.

That may lead to validation errors if an imported XSD is ISO-8859-1 encoded and containing non ASCII caracters, even though that XSD declares its encoding correctly in its XML prolog.
7885	Route Exchange TimerEndpoint Timer - Restarting a timer endpoint may not trigger at expected time the first timeIf you stop a timer route, and that route has an inflight exchange causing the stop route to force stop due timeout. Then that timer task is still running in the background.And if you restart the timer route, then it will reuse the old timer instance, which may be still running, and therefore the first trigger time may not happen at the time you would expect.For example from timer:foo?period=2s to trigger every 2s.
7896	producer header header Channel camel-netty-http producer should close the channel when the connection header is not keep aliveIf the http request connection header is "keep alive", camel http producer will not close the channel. It can cause some trouble if the response connection header is "close".  We need to close the channel if the response connection header is "close".
7909	Consumer camel-netty-http consumer need to close the connection if the response connection header is closeCurrent Netty Http Consumer decided if it need to close connection by checking the request connection header. But if the response connection header is &amp;apos;close&amp;apos;,  the netty http consumer need to close the connection at the same time.

8160	annotation Generic methods used as endpoints fail in Java 8In Java 8 annotations are duplicated to generics&amp;apos; bridge methods.  Camel, rightly, does not support bridge methods as endpoints.  However, because of this change in the language annotations such as @Consume will end up on them after compilation leaving Camel in an invalid state.I will attach a sample project.This ticket is from this discussion thread: http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Changes-in-Java-8-generics-breaking-Camel-td5760638.html

8578	null camel-http - May double encode uri when using HTTP_URI or HTTP_QUERY headersSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Apache-Camel-decodes-HTTP-query-params-and-httpclient-fails-with-Invalid-query-exception-tp5764794p5764843.html
8587	Exchange Exceptions from multicast aggregators are not propagated to the global exception handlerWhen a multicast aggregator throws an exception, either directly or by setting the exception to the returned exchange, the exception is just logged instead of being  propagated to the global exception handler.
8636	Consumer Offset camel-kafka need to commit the last batch of messages when the auto commit is falseCAMEL-8085 introduced a new feature of commit the consumer offset in batch mode, but it doesn&amp;apos;t commit the last batch of messages.
8660	Exchange camel-ftp - Disconnect when no messages dont call disconnectIts due disconnect is now done as part of UoW to not disconnect before deleting files etc.But if there is no messages then the UoW is not called as no Exchange. In that case we should disconnect if its true.See nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/FTP-disconnect-problem-tp5765934.html
8683	LoadBalancer Route Using load balancer in onException adds duplicate outputs for each route definedIf using load balancer in context scoped onException then it adds duplicate outputs per route you have. So if you have 3 routes, then there is 2 x duplicates as there is 2 additional routes.
8708	null SOAP unmarshalling shouldn&apos;t fail for Faults that lack an optional Detail elementCamel-soap code assumes that all Faults that a Camel SOAP endpoint is receiving, are containing a Detail element. Sending a Fault without Detail will result in an NPE. Detail is optional element in SOAP Faults (see http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#soapfault) and its absence should not generate an error.
8718	FTPConsumer Connection leak with ftp consumer and invalid credentialsIn each iteration new socket connection is created, but never closed. This leads to growth of ESTABLISHED connections to FTP server.
8909	Main method method method Jasypt CLI outputs help twiceUsing -help results in the following output:[janstey@bender apache-camel-2.15.2]$ java -jar lib/camel-jasypt-2.15.2.jar -helpApache Camel Jasypt takes the following options-h or -help = Displays the help screen-c or -command &lt;command&gt; = Command either encrypt or decrypt-p or -password &lt;password&gt; = Password to use-i or -input &lt;input&gt; = Text to encrypt or decrypt-a or -algorithm &lt;algorithm&gt; = Optional algorithm to useError: Command is emptyApache Camel Jasypt takes the following options-h or -help = Displays the help screen-c or -command &lt;command&gt; = Command either encrypt or decrypt-p or -password &lt;password&gt; = Password to use-i or -input &lt;input&gt; = Text to encrypt or decrypt-a or -algorithm &lt;algorithm&gt; = Optional algorithm to use
8945	null Loop - Should break out looping if exception happened during routingSee SOhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31312281/apache-camel-loop-does-not-stop-on-exception
9012	null Olingo2&apos;s batch process generates the invalid requestThe syntax check of olingo2 lib was tighten from version 2.0.1.As a result, the batch message generated by camel-ollingo2&amp;apos;s is rejected by olingo2 version 2.0.1 and newer.Concretely, the current message includes two extra new lines within the batch part that is rejected by the olingo2 library.OLINGO-739We should remove these two extra lines.
9032	Bean component AmbiguousMethodCallException Bean component - Should filter out abstract methodsIf you call a method on a bean then the introspector should filter out abstract methods if there is class inheritance with abstract defined methods.See SOhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31671894/camel-ambiguousmethodcallexception-abstract-classes
9140	null Missing configuration properties in camel-facebookFor the new request methods that were introduced with the Facebook4j 2.x version (see CAMEL-7634) some new parameter arguments are required but were not added to the endpoint configuration (e.g. pageId for getPage) and thus endpoints for this methods fail to resolve.For example, the following does not work: facebook://getPage?pageId=6538157161
9150	null Seda suspend/resume should not trigger start/stop logicSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Suspend-Resume-Routes-Unreliable-tp5771723.htmlThe doResume method is calling doStart which may setup tasks.
9171	null camel-xmpp processes no messages when running in KarafCamel XMPP communication is not working in version 2.15.3 when running in Karaf. The feature installation works fine but no messages are processed.I guess this is potentially based on changing the Smack version from 3 to 4.Based on the existing Camel Karaf tests I created a simple test which passes with Camel Version 2.14.3 and fails with Camel Version 2.15.3. The test can be found here https://github.com/achim86/karaf-xmpp (remember to start the XMPPServer before running the test as described in the readme).
9247	null rest-dsl with api-doc should allow multiple rest&apos;sSee SOhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33291657/how-to-have-multiple-camel-rest-dsl-definitions-with-swaggerThe api-doc endpoint should merge multiple rest&amp;apos;s together.
9255	XPath documentType not used for XPath predicates in XML DSLthe documentType paramter is not used for XPath predicates in XML DSL. It works for XPath expression and in Java DSL
9311	DynamicRouter method Concurrency issue with the dynamic routerWe have a service with two HTTP contexts:http://0.0.0.0:9000/endpoin1/dynamic"http://0.0.0.0:9000/endpoin2/dynamic"Both endpoints can be called using a HTTP GET method and a dynamic router routes the message differently.Each HTTP endpoint  has its own instance of the dynamic router bean. The dynamic router bean does not use any shared state.When the HTTP endpoints are called sequentially the calls are handled as expected. When the HTTP endpoints are called concurrently then sometimes the the dynamic router of the 9000/endpoin1/dynamic endpoint is re-routing calls originating from 9000/endpoin2/dynamic and vice versa.Please take a look at attached unit test case for more detail.
9381	null Upgrade camel-amqp to the latest qpid-jms-clientWe should upgrade camel-amqp to use the latest qpid-jms-client. That would mean that we should also drop support for AMQP &lt; 1.0.
9386	null Camel-git: Support credentials in clone operationAs noted here: https://github.com/oscerd/camel-git/issues/1Currently we don&amp;apos;t support credentials for the clone operation.
9491	component statement.maxRows not working as expected camel jdbcI have tested inmultiple versio*n i.e. 2.15.1,2.16.0,2.16.1 *also but still the same issue.Camel JDBC component  statement.maxRows is not respected when query is fired repeatedly using a timer. It works fine only on the first run of the route after that the query gets all the records.
9582	RestDefinition XmlRouteParser swagger-api docs not working in only using xml without any java routeSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Swagger-not-working-tp5777255.html
9599	null camel-cxfrs - When responding then do not use content-length from inputThe simple binding of cxfrs uses the content-length header from the input as the response content-length. It should not do that.
9640	null Query string gets decoded when bridging from netty*-http to netty*-httpThe same problem as CAMEL-9442 but for camel-netty*-http instead of camel-http4.
9641	null Simple backwards parser bug if using fileSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Unknown-File-Language-Syntax-tp5778208.html
9670	null Camel-ftp: No error message on invalid credentialsAs result of CAMEL-8718 the connection will be closed on invalid credentials before throwing an exception.But disconnecting the ftpclient will reset the reply string, so the exception message is null.The attached patch will store the reply string before disconnecting.
9673	Message Processor block doTry .. doFinally should run the finally block for fault messages alsoIf a message has fault flag, then a doFinally block is only executed the first processor. We should ensure the entire block is processed like we do if an exception was thrown. The same kind of logic should apply for fault.
9687	property camel-swagger - Should use resolved placeholders in outputSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/camel-swagger-java-not-parse-property-tp5778734.html
9774	CachedCXFPayload CXFPayload Transformer CXFPayload may lose CDATA sections under stream cachingCAMEL-8410 introduced CachedCXFPayload to add stream-caching support to CXFPayload. This may use during its sequence of conversions the default java.xml.transform.Transformer to convert javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource to SAX, which will then drop CDATA sections because its CDATA handling is empty.http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/com/sun/org/apache/xalan/internal/xsltc/trax/StAXStream2SAX.java#StAXStream2SAX.handleCDATA%28%29To avoid this, CachedCXFPayload can use the conversion utility already included in CXF.
9777	ZipIterator DataFormat camel-zipfile - Using zip iterator with dataformat may failThe zip entry may say the current size of the entry is -1 while there is still data.
9854	document test CXF Stream Cache contains duplicate namespace definitionIf stream caching is enabled for incoming messages in Camel-CXF and a namespace defined on the SOAP envelope is also defined on the root tag of the payload document the XML contained within the stream cache contains a duplicate namespace definition.See attached unit test for details
9906	SQLComponent camel-sql - Should allow null values as a valid valueSee nabblehttp://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/2-17-0-NULLs-are-not-allowed-with-named-parameter-in-SQL-component-tp5781552.html
9917	Route Route stopped events are sent in inconsistent order
9926	Client component HTTP Proxy support in Salesforce component is broken with upgrade to Jetty9HTTP Proxy support in Jetty9 Client is broken, which causes HTTP Proxy tests in the Salesforce components to fail.They have been marked as ignored for now, but it MUST be fixed in Jetty9 ASAP and the component updated to use the new version of Jetty9 client with working support for Proxy authentication.
9933	Message configuration Camel-CSV marshalling breaks characters not in default charsetMarshalling data with camel-csv will use the JVM default encoding instead of the one configured for the message. This will break non-ascii characters, especially if the platform default encoding does not support them (e.g. because the platform default encoding is ASCII)
9986	Format MIME-Multipart Data Format is inconsistent if trying to unmarshal non-MIME dataIf data that is not a MIME-Multipart is tried to marshal with the headersInline option set to false, no error is thrown and the message is left as the original message.In case the headersInline option is set to true, an empty message is returned.The provided patch changes the behavior that it also tries to return the original message in case the message is not a mime-multipart and headersInline is set to true. However there are limits to this: If the message body is a stream and stream caching is not enabled it is necessary to read the stream in order to find out whether this is a MIME-Multipart or not. Afterwards the message body will be empty (as with the previous implementation).
